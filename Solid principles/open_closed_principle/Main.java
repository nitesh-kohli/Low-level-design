//open/closed principle
//Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
//Benefits of Following OCP
//âœ… No need to modify existing code when adding new shapes.
//âœ… New shapes can be added independently by implementing the Shape interface.
//âœ… Better maintainability and scalability.

//By following the Open-Closed Principle, our system becomes extensible and future-proof ðŸš€.
